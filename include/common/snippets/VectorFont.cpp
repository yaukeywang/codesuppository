// This code snippet allows you to render a high quality vector line font.
// The font it uses is called the 'Hershey Font' (search for it on Google).
// This font is completely public domain and you are free to use it in
// your own applications.
//
//
// Here is how you use this code snippet.
//
// Step #1 : Create an instance of the VectorFont pure virtual interface.
// Step #2 : call 'vprintf' with the transform, scale, center flag, and text you wish to print.
// Step #3 : Dispatch individual line segments to your own rendering framework.
// Step #4 : Release the VectorFont class.
//
// Here is an example usage in C++
//
// class MyLineDraw : public VectorFontInterfac
// {
//     public:
//      virtual void drawLine(NxF32 x1,NxF32 y1,NxF32 x2,NxF32 y2)
//      {
//        // Right here, in this callback, draw the line using your own line draw interface, OpenGL, D3D, or whatever works for you.
//      }
//    };
//
//
//    MyLineDraw mld; // create an instance of our callback class to draw individual line segments.
//
//    VectorFont *vf = createVectorFont(&mld);
//    vf->vprintf(NULL,1,true,"This is a test of the emergency broadcasting system.");
//    releaseVectorFont(vf);

//This distribution is made possible through the collective encouragement

//        This distribution of the Hershey Fonts may be used by anyone for
//        any purpose, commercial or otherwise, providing that:
//                1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with
//                        the font data:
//                        - The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.

//                                National Bureau of Standards.

//                                was originally created by

//                        any other format *EXCEPT* the format distributed by
//                        the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights
//                        to the distribution and use of the font data in that
//                        particular format). Not that anybody would really
//                        *want* to use their format... each point is described
//                        in eight bytes as "xxx yyy:", where xxx and yyy are
//                        the coordinate values as ASCII numbers.
