	*.cpp to define this variables. Only what we can have are constants
	defined by #define preprocessor macros.

		Some kind of methods use a reference as their argument to another object,

		macro TTMATH_REFERENCE_ASSERT helps us to solve the above problem

		note! some methods can use 'this' object as the argument

			UInt<2> foo(10);
			foo.Add(foo);
